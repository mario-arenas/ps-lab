                    <h4>What got you into this business in the first place?</h4>
                    <p>My love of color, people and retail.</p>

                
                    <h4>What was growing up like for you?</h4>
                    <p>I grew up with very few immediate family members, since all my relatives were left behind in Cuba in the 1960&rsquo;s. My family bonded and until this day we call each other every day. Lots of succulent pork, spiced black beans and music. The complete Cuban-style family!</p>

                
                    <h4>What makes a great brand?</h4>
                    <p>Clarity, honesty, reliance, fun and of course great looking packaging.</p>

                
                    <h4>What frustrates you the most?</h4>
                    <p>Selfishness. Lack of caring for others. Self-centeredness.</p>

                
                    <h4>If you had to live on a desert island, what would you miss most?</h4>
                    <p>Aside from my down pillow? New York City vitality.</p>

                
                    <h4>What is your motto?</h4>
                    <p>There is only one life to live, might as well love what you do.</p>
