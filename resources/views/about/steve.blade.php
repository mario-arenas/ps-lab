                    <h4>What got you into this business in the first place?</h4>
                    <p>My family is extremely creative both musically and artistically. I was drawn to the arts at an early age and became aware very quickly that it is also a business.</p>

                
                    <h4>What attracted you to Parham Santana?</h4>
                    <p>As a fierce competitor of my previous company I was always a fan of their creative work and business model, specifically their vision on branding.</p>

                
                    <h4>Is there a great client success story you would like to share?</h4>
                    <p>Working on a then relatively unknown property which has become one of the most successful animated movie franchises of all time.</p>

                
                    <h4>What was growing up like for you?</h4>
                    <p>I grew up in Queens, New York to Italian immigrants who strived to create a better life for their children. As a product of the 70&#39;s I enjoyed a great childhood with lots of friends and family.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;">We played on the street back then and had to be dragged back into the house, no video games, cable TV and cell phones.</span></p>

                
                    <h4>If you had to live on a deserted island what would you miss most?</h4>
                    <p>My mother&#39;s meatballs.</p>
