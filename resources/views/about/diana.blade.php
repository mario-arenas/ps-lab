                <p>Diana is a champion of structure and practitioner of disruptive fresh writing. With expertise based in experience and a constant attention to consumer trends, she is often called upon to write the line that expresses a brand&rsquo;s new positioning. In this regard, she wrote Follow Your Inner Star for American Girl, A Little Wonder Goes a Long Way for PBS Kids and The Hug You Wear for Snugli.</p>

    <p>Diana is also a published playwright and optioned screenwriter, as well as writing coach and teacher with a strong philosophy based on the principles of story construction. She founded WordWorks, one of the premier ad agencies in the Berkshires. Diana comes from a long line of English teachers and she received her BA in English at Rochester University.</p>

                
                
                    <h4>What got you into this business in the first place?</h4>
                    <p>I was always a wizard with words and it seemed like a natural place to apply my talent.</p>

                
                    <h4>Who was a big influence in your career? </h4>
                    <p>My mother. &nbsp;She was an English teacher and a stickler for grammar. Seeing a sign that said, for example, Baking At It&rsquo;s Best would drive her crazy. &nbsp;(If you can name all the mistakes, you probably studied with her.)</p>

                
                    <h4>What was "your finest moment," the thing you're most proud of? </h4>
                    <p>My two sons, although that is happily more than one moment.</p>

                
                    <h4>Do you have a method for coming up with ideas and solutions for clients? </h4>
                    <p>I read everything I can on client and industry; and then sleep on it. &nbsp;In the morning, ideas flow.</p>

                
                    <h4>What is your motto? </h4>
                    <p>On to the next thing.</p>
