                    <h4>What got you into this business in the first place?</h4>
                    <p>I started my career in entertainment where licensing holds a prominent position. Over time, I learned more about the industry and steered my career more toward the latter and less the former.</p>

                
                    <h4>Do you have a method for coming up with solutions for clients?</h4>
                    <p>Careful attention to both client and consumer needs. I&rsquo;ve found the best results stem from taking a hard look at the market and aligning it with both brand values and program objectives.</p>

                
                    <h4>What do you do for a good time when youâ€™re not working?</h4>
                    <p>Enjoy family time with my two boys.</p>

                
                    <h4>Who was a big influence in your career?</h4>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky in that I&rsquo;ve had the fortune of working with several great managers and supervisors over my career. They played a large part in shaping who I became as a professional.</p>

                
                    <h4>What is your motto?</h4>
                    <p>Strive for excellence.</p>
