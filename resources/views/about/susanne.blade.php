                    <h4>What got you into this business in the first place?</h4>
                    <p>I loved to shop, and was thrilled to realize that I could make a career of my passion.</p>

                
                    <h4>Who was a big influence in your career?</h4>
                    <p>My grandmother, who was an incredibly talented seamstress in Honduras. She used to produce exquisite dresses, inspired by Parisian couturiers. I remember every dress she made for me.</p>

                
                    <h4>Do you have a method for coming up with solutions for clients?</h4>
                    <p>Walking a store; watching customers interact with the brand. What matters is what happens at the point of sale.</p>

                
                    <h4>What was growing up like for you?</h4>
                    <p>Lots of time outdoors, on our bikes; exploring the stream nearby our house. But lots of reading, too. My father used to bring home a big bag of books from the library for me every other week.</p>

                
                    <h4>What makes a great brand?</h4>
                    <p>A promise that resonates with customers&rsquo; needs and interests. Focus. Consistency. Discipline.</p>
