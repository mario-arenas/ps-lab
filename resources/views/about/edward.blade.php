                <p>Ed coined the term &ldquo;Brand Extension&rdquo; in 1979 to describe using the leverage of a well known brand name in one category to launch a new product in a different category. As a result, he formed Brand Extension Research in 1981 to develop brand extensions for major clients. He is a pioneer of brand extension insights that look beyond just measuring consumer permission to also identify a brand&rsquo;s unique competitive advantage to ensure success. Ed has identified and launched new products valued in the hundreds of millions. His major successes include Nestle-Gerber Infant Formula, Clorox Clean-up, Dole Fruit &amp; Juice Bars and Snickers Ice Cream Bars.</p>

    <p>A former Director of Research for Dancer, Fitzgerald, Sample NY (Saatchi) and Director of Market Research at Nestle-Carnation, Ed holds a Ph.D. in Business from Cornell, and an MA Economics from University of Virginia.</p>

                
                
                    <h4>What got you into this business in the first place?</h4>
                    <p>While I was doing a research internship on Pillsbury products, I was asked to work on a new product. I&rsquo;ve been hooked on new product development ever since.</p>

                
                    <h4>What was “your finest moment,” the thing you’re most proud of?</h4>
                    <p>Identifying the concept of brand extension and giving it that name. Developing Clorox Cleanup and Nestle Formula. These are by far my biggest accomplishments in terms of new products that sell in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

                
                    <h4>What attracted you to Parham Santana?</h4>
                    <p>A phone call from John. And an entire company that focuses on brand extension. WOW!</p>

                
                    <h4>What makes a great brand?</h4>
                    <p>One that owns something leverageable. That means it can communicate a distinctive benefit in other categories just from the associations with the brand name itself.</p>

                
                    <h4>What was growing up like for you?</h4>
                    <p>Don&rsquo;t know. Never did that.</p>
