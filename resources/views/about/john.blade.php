                <p>John has 25+ years experience helping national brands extend and restage in the retail world. John&#39;s positioning and brand extension strategies for clients have guided long-term multi-billion-dollar retail programs for thousands of products at major national retailers in every channel of distribution &ndash; including Walmart, Kohl&rsquo;s, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and Macy&#39;s. Parham Santana&#39;s unique perspective is based on a client base that includes direct involvement with the full roster of major national retailers, brand owners, licensing agents, as well as&nbsp;manufacturers&nbsp;and licensees.</p>

    <p>John is a LIMA board member and has a Certified Licensing Degree from LIMA, is a member of the In-Store Marketing Institute and has a Master&#39;s in Communication from Pratt Institute.</p>

                
                
                    <h4>What was "your finest moment," the thing you're most proud of?</h4>
                    <p>Having a friend return from Mongolia with a piece of a global re-branding program our firm had recently completed.</p>

                
                    <h4>Is there a great client story you'd care to share?</h4>
                    <p>We recently completed a major seasonal branding program&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;trend, creative, in-store marketing, promotion and product direction for a national retailer. I have e-mails from the CMO on down exclaiming this to be their best seasonal program in 10 years. It&rsquo;s a billion dollar compliment.</p>

                
                    <h4>Do you have a method for coming up with ideas and solutions for clients?</h4>
                    <p>Two smart people that respect one another in a room. They must have a working knowledge of the client and their marketplace challenges. Add two pencils and some paper and you&rsquo;re off.</p>

                
                    <h4>What makes a great brand?</h4>
                    <p>When you can close your eyes and feel it. Great brands have a resonance that goes beyond anything visual.</p>

                
                    <h4>What talent do you wish you had?</h4>
                    <p>I wish I could play more than the tambourine.</p>

                
                    <h4>Is there any food that helps you think more creatively?</h4>
                    <p>I think better when I&#39;m hungry.</p>

                
                    <h4>What was growing up like for you?</h4>
                    <p>Very &lsquo;Tom Sawyer.&rsquo; I grew up in Kentucky and I have fond memories of not wearing shoes all summer and spending lots of time in the woods catching crawdads in the creek with my friends and my dog, &ldquo;Boston.&rdquo; The Schwinn &ldquo;Stingray&rdquo; bike was the preferred means of transportation.</p>

                
                    <h4>What is your motto?</h4>
                    <p>I have two from distinct sources but they say the same thing. &quot;Our future is in ourselves; not our stars.&quot; Shakespeare, Julius Caesar. And, &quot;The harder I work, the luckier I get.&quot; Dave Berry, Wendy&#39;s</p>

                
                    <h4>What is your current state of mind?</h4>
                    <p>Positive. Anything is possible.</p>

                
                    <h4>What do you consider the most overrated virtue?</h4>
                    <p>Patience.</p>
