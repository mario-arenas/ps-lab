                    <h4>What got you into this business in the first place?</h4>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been an attorney for 28 years and an intellectual property attorney for more than 20 years. I started in software licensing, then migrated to brand licensing. What I like about IP law in general and licensing law in particular is that they are always fresh, always interesting.</p>

                
                    <h4>What attracted you to Parham Santana?</h4>
                    <p>John and all the other Parham Santana professionals are people of high creativity, who are guided by a strong ethical sense in their business dealings.</p>

                
                    <h4>What was college like for you?</h4>
                    <p>My best memories from college were working on the school newspaper, pulling all-nighters to finish the articles and get the issue out. Facing deadlines, you learned who had talent and who your friends were.</p>

                
                    <h4>What is your motto?</h4>
                    <p>Fix it or forget it.</p>

                
                    <h4>What's your favorite sports team?</h4>
                    <p>I&rsquo;m a recovering Mets fan. That&rsquo;s all I care to say on the subject.</p>
